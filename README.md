# WORD SCRAMBLE

First project

WORD SCRAMBLE is a game that test your spelling skills so when the game is started a random word is generated and the player has to guess letters until the word is spelled out.
every time the player guesses a correct letter they get to select another letter. when the player guesses wrong they lose a try. the player gets 5 tries and if the player uses all 5 tries the game is over. if the player guesses all of the right letters you win the game
