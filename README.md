# WORD SCRAMBLE

First project

WORD SCRAMBLE is a game that test your spelling skills so when the game is started a random word is generated and the player has to guess letters until the word is spelled out.
every time the player guesses a correct letter they get to select another letter. when the player guesses wrong they keep guessing until they get it right. if the player guesses all of the right letters you they can click on the generate word button and a new word will generate for the player to try and guess. After the player gets all the words correct the game is over.

- As a user, I want to have an input bar for guesses to be submitted into.
- As a user, I want the right guessed letter to populate in the correct area in th correct order.
- As a user, I want the wrong letters to populate in another box so the player knows they guessed a wrong letter.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:

I could not get the game to show the end screen saying you win!
also could not get the wrong letters box to refresh when a new word is generated

my biggest hurdle was getting the input box to work and populate the letters where they belong also had a lot of trouble getting it to cycle through the words and the correct amount of spaces to fit the length of the word it was generating
