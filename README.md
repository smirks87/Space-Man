# Space-Man
First project 

space man is a game that the space mans has crash landed on a planet and his spaceship is wrecked so when the game is started a random word is generated and the player has to guess letters until the word is spelled out.
every time the player guesses a correct letter you add a part to your spaceship. when the player guesses wrong they lose a try. the player gets 3 tries and if the player uses all 3 tries the game is over. if the player guesses all of the right letters you build your spaceship and win the game
