# WORD SCRAMBLE

First project

WORD SCRAMBLE is a game that test your spelling skills so when the game is started a random word is generated and the player has to guess letters until the word is spelled out.
every time the player guesses a correct letter they get to select another letter. when the player guesses wrong they keep guessing until they get it right. if the player guesses all of the right letters you they can click on the generate word button and a new word will generate for the player to try and guess. After the player gets all the words correct the game is over.
